   // See Constant_UserActivityTypes - Many of the properties in this object are used by some types and not used by others.
   //
   // "New" and "Previous" - In some cases we only need to report a "thing", i.e. a chunk, a lesson, etc.
   //                        For example, when the user suppresses a chunk, we only need to know which chunk.
   //                        In other cases we want to know the previous thing and the new thing.
   //                        For example, when the app auto-advances from one lesson to another.
   //                        Note that "previous" and "new" as used here shouldn't be confused with the Play Lessons screen's Previous & Next buttons.
   //                        For example, if the user clicks the Previous Lesson button while in the middle of a lesson, both lessonId_Previous and
   //                        lessonId_New would be the current lesson, as the result of the user's click would be to go to the first chunk in that lesson.
