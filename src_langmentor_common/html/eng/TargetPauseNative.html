    <p>Use this mode to practice translating from %target_language_name% into %native_language_name%. In this mode you'll be repeatedly presented with:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A word or phrase in %target_language_name%</li>
        <li>A pause during which you can attempt to translate the %target_language_name% into %native_language_name%
        </li>
        <li>A correct %native_language_name% translation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>&quot;%target_language_example%&quot;</li>
        <li>Pause</li>
        <li>&quot;%native_language_example%&quot;</li>
    </ul>
